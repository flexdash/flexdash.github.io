FlexDash is a dashboard that runs in the browser and is fully self-contained:
feed it data over a websocket and save its config as a blob on the server and you have an IoT dashboard.

FlexDash is currently in use with [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) and in the [SensorGnome](https://docs.motus.org/sensorgnome/) project.
The Node-RED integration is currently being worked on...
